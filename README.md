masks seem to be the cause of the .to() error, too. No pun intended?

Variational Auto Encoder notebook: this was a half baked idea that went farther than I thought, but not far enough to be effective.


conclusion: it's hard to make a better ml algorithm than these kaggle masters: that said, there would be a shot at it if I found a way to reliably rotate the masks.
The reason I think this is because the rotated images look really slick. I can barely even tell they have the rotation gaps in the corners.
